 1 & Use Kinetic Kame as our ROS distribution & Used Indigo Igloo instead & The older version of ROS was more commonly used in other code samples, so the team used it instead for compatibility\\
 \hline
 2 & Submit patches for vulnerabilites upstream & Didn't create any patches & All the vulnerabilities we found were based in how ROS was designed, not a code exploit or bug. So there really was not anything to patch.\\

%The only explicit change we had to our requirements was that our team used 
%ROS Indigo Igloo over Kinetic Kame, as a large part of the existing ROS codebase
%was created during Indigo and Kame had some compatibility issues with some 
%Indigo-based code. There was also the understanding that we would not be 
%producing patches to patch any vulnerabilities we found, as all of them
%stem from underlying design choices in ROS itself rather than programming
%errors. This makes everything more or less unpatchable, as it would require
%design changes to ROS itself that are simply not in consideration by the 
%ROS development team. In turn, since our team produced no patches, we did 
%not send them to the SROS project for consideration either.
