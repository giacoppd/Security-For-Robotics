\LARGE\textbf{Introduction\\ \\}
\normalsize Our project was proposed by Vedanth Narayanan, a graduate student in CS at 
OSU, as a way to generate material for his masterâ€™s thesis. For his thesis 
he plans to do something with security in ROS, the Robotics Operating System 
and henceforth referred to as ROS for the rest of this document, and our 
work was to discover and document security vulnerabilities for him to use as 
testing material later, along with identifying what parts of ROS were the most 
vulnerable overall. Vedanth was also our client for the project, and we, the team, 
were, in no particular order, Dominic Giacoppe, Emily Longman, and Zachary Rogers. 
The team had no defined roles at the outset, but over time Emily became the primary 
research design and compiler, Zach was the hardware specialist before the team 
decided to drop hardware from consideration from the project, and Dominic was the 
ROS expert and was the go-between for the team and Vedanth. Vedanth produced a 
small bit of code for the team, but on the whole took a supervisor position for 
the duration of the project, mostly providing ideas for what to explore next 
and detailing what he expected from the team at any given time. \\
