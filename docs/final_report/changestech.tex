\LARGE\textbf{Technology changes\\\\}\normalsize
The only technologies that were cut were those related to the drone, and SROS.
Since we had no drone, we had no need for a drone operating system, nor did 
we care about drone networking or communications, and hence those were all 
ignored. The reasons for dropping SROS are detailed as part of the design 
document discussion, and the team used regular ROS for the rest of the project. 
Our project did not use any additional technologies not listed in the tech doc.
