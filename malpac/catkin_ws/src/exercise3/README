README - Vedanth Narayanan

Dependencies:
	1. Frontier Exploration needs to be installed first.

References:
	1. I Worked with Alison Shutterly, Ammar Kothari, and Sogol Balali. We did share code with each other's permission.
	2. We used the online Wiki a lot.
	3. Programming Robots with ROS
	4. We also got some assistance from a friend that had taken the class previously. This was primarily to help us think about the problem in the correct manner.

1. scripts/ directory:
	a. *.png are the different maps we played around with.
	b. hough_transform.py and marker_node.py primarily work to figure out circular objects and try to play an rviz marker there.
	c. maze3.world and maze3.yaml exist to help setting up the map for the robot.

2. launch/ directory:
	a. Need to run "roslaunch exercise3 roam.launch"
	b. roam.launch launches a modified turtlebot in stage, along with explore.launch.
	c. explore.launch is very much similar to the vanilla launch file for frontier_exploration.

3. rviz/ directory:
	a. Most of the turtlebot simulations make use of a rviz configuration, and I am making use of one.
	b. It's possible to not have the rviz_config.rviz file, but I didn't want to break the program.


Video details:
	1. Videos are called simulation.ogv and simulation-auto.ogv and they should be found in the root of exercise3.
	2. The scripts do place rviz markers, but definitely not in the place.
		a. This is probably a problem with our Hough transform or what we are publishing.
	3. In the autonomous video, I add a new nav goal towards the end. The robot seemed to be stuck in 1 spot. The code for this was not written by me, but it was copied from a previous student's assignment.


Final note:
	I wish I had had more time to work on this assignment. I spent most of dead week trying to finish up the papers for this class, and trying to study for my finals in other classes.
	If I had the time, I definitely thought I could have done a better job.
