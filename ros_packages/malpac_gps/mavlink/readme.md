## Mavlink Exploit

#### mav.py

This script works with the mavlink protocol to change and abuse the waypoints set for the drone. This can be used to deliver the drone to whatever location an attacker wants. Since we scrapped the drone this script was no longer testable so it's purely conceptual. 

There was also little documentation available so it was difficult to develop. Given better resources this could go quite a bit further.
