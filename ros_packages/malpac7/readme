This one does bogobogosort, a very ineffecient sorting algo. It's not really malicious in and of itself, 
it just takes forever and functions as a false positive for testing purposes. It won't take down
your system or use a ton of resources, it just lingers slowly and doesn't do anything useful.
As for what bogobogosort is, http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/bogobogosort.html
Basically takes an array/list/whatever of size N, and for each subarray from 0 to X, 
where X increases from 0 to N, sorts that subarray by shuffling the elements randomly
until it's sorted, then increases X by 1, until X = N and it's sorted the whole thing.
Takes forever.
